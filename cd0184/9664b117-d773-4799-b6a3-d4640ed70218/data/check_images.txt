Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
No, the three model architectures did not classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg the same way.
Both AlexNet and ResNet misclassified it as "newfoundland, newfoundland dog," while the VGG model correctly identified it as "leonberg."


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
No, each of the three model architectures did not classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg the same way as they did for Dog_02.jpg. AlexNet and ResNet both misclassified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as "newfoundland, newfoundland dog." However, the VGG model correctly classified both images as "leonberg."


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
Yes, all three models correctly identified that Animal_Name_01.jpg (Giraffe_01.jpg) and Object_Name_01.jpg (coffee_mug.jpg) were not dogs.
Although they incorrectly classified Giraffe_01.jpg in terms of its specific species, they still recognized it as a non-dog entity. The coffee mug image was correctly classified as "cup" by AlexNet and VGG, and as "coffee mug" by ResNet.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
I think the VGG model performed the best overall. It accurately identified the breed of the dog in both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as "leonberg." Although it misclassified the giraffe image, it still recognized it as a non-dog, which was consistent with the other models.
The VGG model's high accuracy in dog breed identification makes it the most reliable choice among the three models for this set of images.
